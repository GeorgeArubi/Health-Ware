This is a prototype for an Electronic Medical Record app.
We will be creating a full-stack login/authorization app using
the PERN stack (PostgreSQL for our database, Express and Node for
our backend, and React for our frontened). We will be using JWT
(JSON Web Token) for user authentication.

Our app will allow users to register and log into our app, which
will then run a query to retrieve the user's medical 
chart from their primary hospital's database.



Potential Challenges:
Our databse solution works for small environments, but the problem 
is the depreciation in performance from connecting retrieving, storing data 
temporarily in memory. Closing that connection and going to the next hospital 
for querying, etc. takes up a lot of resources and processing time. 
Granted, two hospitals are not a real big deal with this model, but I retrievind 
data at scale may prove difficult.
